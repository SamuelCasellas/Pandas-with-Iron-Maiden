# Pandas-with-Iron-Maiden
Here I will dive into the pandas library in Python to analyze the underlying themes in Iron Maiden's music.

# My notes

- Two ways to find the themes on the music
- Use a library like sentiment or another one I find
- I was able to download the songs faster using threads available from the concurrent.futures library
