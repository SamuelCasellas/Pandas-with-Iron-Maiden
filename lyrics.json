"The Fugitive": "On a cold October morning\r\nAs frost lay on the ground\r\nWaiting to make my move\r\nI make no sound\r\n\r\nWaiting for the mist to cover all around\r\nI carefully picked my time\r\nThen took the wall\r\n\r\nI'm sick and tired of running\r\nThe hunger and the pain\r\nA stop to look about then off again\r\n\r\nBeing at the wrong place\r\nAnd the wrong time\r\nSuspected of a hit that was my crime\r\n\r\nI am a fugitive being hunted down\r\nLike game\r\nI am a fugitive but I've got to clear\r\nMy name\r\n\r\nAlways looking 'round me\r\nForever looking back\r\nI'll always be a target for attack\r\n\r\nEver moving onwards\r\nAlways on the run\r\nWaiting for the sight of a loaded gun\r\n\r\nI am a fugitive being hunted down\r\nLike game\r\nI am a fugitive but I've got to clear\r\nMy name\r\n\r\nEven if I find them\r\nAnd get to clear my name\r\nI know that things can never\r\nBe the same\r\n\r\nBut if I ever prove\r\nMy innocence some day\r\nI've got to get them all to make them pay\r\n\r\nI am a fugitive being hunted down\r\nLike game\r\nI am a fugitive but I've got to clear\r\nMy name", "The Alchemist": "Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky\nStranger than the truth I know before my open eyes\nI have dealt in mysteries and trickery of light to entertain\nLooked into the abyss, called it by its name\n\nI have plundered time itself, put the world inside it\nI'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it\nA plague of wonders, on your knees beside me\nKnow the secrets, you shall not deride us\n\nMy dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass\nKnow me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this is my house\nI am the master of the tides, I shame the mirror in my sight\nWhat random music of the spheres across the years\n\nKnow this, I will return to this land\nRebuild where the ruins did stand\nChain up the demons set free\nStrange alchemy\n\nGather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame\nHear the master summon up the spirits by their names\nI curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned\nKnow you speak with demons, you cannot command\n\nEven as I looked into the glass then I was blinded\nBurning by the Mortlake shore, my house, my books inside it\nYou have taken up my wife and lain beside her\nNow the black rain on my house, the timbers burning\n\nMy dreams of empire from my frozen queen will come to pass\nKnow me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee and this was my house\nI was the keeper of the books, I had the knowledge of the scrolls\nBut now through ignorance and fear, I cast a shadow through the years\n\nKnow this, I will return to this land\nRebuild where the ruins did stand\nChain up the demons set free\nStrange alchemy\n\nKnow this, I will return to this land\nRebuild where the ruins did stand\nChain up the demons set free\nStrange alchemy\n\nKnow this, I will return to this land\nRebuild where the ruins did stand\nRestore the knowledge memory\nStrange alchemy\n\n", "The Talisman": "When I stand and look about the port\nAnd contemplate my life, will I ever see my countrymen again?\n\nAs the captain calls us on the deck, I take my things and walk\nTo the harbor side I glance back one last time\nFleeing our nation, our problems we leave behind\nShips by the tenfold sail out on the tide\n\nWe are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea\nFree from our troubles and more free from thee\nInheritors unfulfilled reason behind us\nWe flee from what is not, what is will be\n\nWe flee the earth and face our harsh reality\nWill death be low mist that hangs on the sea?\nWe run from the evil tongues, rash judgments, selfish men\nNever to be seen on these shores again\n\nAs we sail into ocean size and lose sight of land\nA face of contentment around in the air\nWe're off now to seek all our fortunes\nTo the land of our dreams\n\nRiding the waves and the storm is upon us\nThe winds lash the sails but the ropes keep them tight\nOff in the distance a dark cloud approaching\nNone could imagine what there was to come\n\nNo, there's no one going back, no, there's not a second chance\nAs we strap onto the side, we pray to God that we won't die\n\nAs we ride the rough seas, as we soak from the ocean waves\nI just hope for all our lives and pray that I survive\nFour ships are lost in the stormy conditions\nThe spirits of the sunken crews, their phantoms follow us\n\nSpirits, sails, they drive us on through the all consuming waves\nCold mortality, no weapon against these ever raging seas\n\nFour leagues and ten and we hit storms again\nWe just can't get away from the eye of the storm\nThe birds out soar the raging storm but we cannot escape it\nAbandoned earth that we now crave is many leagues from safe\n\nHolding on for our dear lives and we're praying once again\nRotten luck or just jonahed? The talisman is in my hand\n\nLimbs fatigued, trembling with cold, blinded from the sea spray salt\nClasping anything we can hold, heaven's rain upon us falls\nTwenty days without a meal and ten without fresh water still\nThose that didn't die in storms, the scurvy rest did slaughter\n\nWestward the tide, westward we sail on\nWestward the tide, sail by the talisman\n\nWe approach the other side of the ocean with the tide\nIn our favor just for once, welcome greeting, our new land\nThe elation in our hearts, the excitement in our veins\nAs we sail towards the coastline of our golden promised land\n\nWeary limbs fatigued away, I have no life left in me\nNo more strength and nothing left to give, must find the will to live\nNever thought that we could make it, truly sight of shores divine\nThe sickness I am dying from, never wanted it to end this way\n\nWestward the tide, westward we sail on\nWestward the tide, sail by the talisman\nWestward the tide, westward we sail on\nWestward the tide, sail by the talisman\n\n", "For the Greater Good of God": "Are you a man of peace\nOr a man of holy war\nToo many sides to you\nDon't know which anymore\nSo many full of life\nBut also filled with pain\nDon't know just how many\nWill live to breathe again\n\nA life that's made to breathe\nDestruction or defense\nA mind that's vain corruption\nBad or good intent\nA wolf in sheep's clothing\nOr saintly or sinner\nOr some that would believe\nA holy war winner\n\nThey fire off many shots\nAnd many parting blows\nTheir actions beyond a reasoning\nOnly God would know\nAnd as he lies in heaven\nOr it could be in hell\nI feel he's somewhere here\nOr looking from below\nBut I don't know, I don't know\n\nPlease tell me now what life is\nPlease tell me now what love is\nWell tell me now what war is\nAgain tell me what life is\n\nMore pain and misery in the history of mankind\nSometimes it seems more like\nThe blind leading the blind\nIt brings upon us more famine, death and war\nYou know religion has a lot to answer for\n\nPlease tell me now what life is\nPlease tell me now what love is\nWell tell me now what war is\nAgain tell me what life is\n\nAnd as they search to find the bodies in the sand\nThey find its ashes that are\nScattered across the land\nAnd as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind\nA shot is fired somewhere another war begins\n\nAnd all because of it you'd think\nThat we would learn\nBut still the body count the city fires burn\nSomewhere there's someone dying\nIn a foreign land\nMeanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man\nTell me why, tell me why\n\nPlease tell me now what life is\nPlease tell me now what love is\nWell tell me now what war is\nAgain tell me what life is\n\nPlease tell me now what life is\nPlease tell me now what love is\nWell tell me now what war is\nAgain tell me what life is\n\nFor the greater good of God (x8)\n\nPlease tell me now what life is\nPlease tell me now what love is\nWell tell me now what war is\nAgain tell me what life is\n\nPlease tell me now what life is\nPlease tell me now what love is\nWell tell me now what war is\nAgain tell me what life is\n\nFor the greater good of God (x8)\n\nHe gave his life for us\nHe fell upon the cross\nTo die for all of those\nWho never mourn his loss\nIt wasn't meant for us\nTo feel the pain again\nTell me why, tell me why"}
